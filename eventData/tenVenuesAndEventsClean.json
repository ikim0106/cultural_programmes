Suddenly a monolith appears, triggering us to ask, if this is ground zero of humankind evolution? Fast-forwarding to the era of space travelling, a spacecraft is seen propelling into the vast universe, embarking on an exploration accompanied by The Blue Danube. The mysterious monolith then reappears on the Moon, sending signals to Jupiter. To unlock the mystery, the five-men crew switches gears and heads to Jupiter, however, as the supercomputer HAL 9000 pilots the ship, a malfunction brings the astronauts into an unprecedented crisis.\n\nFor this epochal sci-fi masterpiece of immense imagination, Kubrick worked with sci-fi novelist Arthur C. Clarke to create a voyage beginning with our prehistoric ape-ancestry past, and leaping into the future with the birth of the Starchild — an ultimate reflection on human evolution and existence. Then through an episode of computer mutiny to interrogate the encroaching dominance and threat of technologies towards mankind. The vision of the story is profoundly magnificent. The film was produced when computer-generated imagery (CGI) did not exist, nevertheless, the visuals were stunningly outstanding back then, and are still breathtaking as of today.\n\nPost-screening talk in Cantonese\nSpeaker: Dr Derek Lam │ Host: Ernest Chan",

Do not wither. Do not grow old.” In winter, Orlando falls in love with a Russian princess and has even planned an elopement. He dabbles in poetry and art during the centuries that he lives in the castle, and then travels as an ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, but flees after witnessing the first death in a battle. One day, he wakes up and finds himself transformed into a woman. The now Lady Orlando must face questions to her ownership of the estate and limitations she has never experienced as a man before. The castle becomes a prison, and the garden is like a maze.\n\nBased on Virginia Woolf’s novel of the same name, director Sally Potter divided the fantastical story into seven chapters; beginning with death and ending with birth, with 400 years in between. Tilda Swinton plays the androgynous Orlando, addressing a journey of self-discovery as they stare into the camera directly and speak to the audience. British queer icon Quentin Crisp’s portrayal of the Queen and Jimmy Somerville starring as both a falsetto and an angel approaching the end of the film pleasantly breaks the concept of binary opposition.\n\nPost-screening talk in Cantonese \nSpeaker: Prof Mary Wong",

Mochizuki and Shiori work for the station, and are busy collecting precious memories from the newly deceased, which will be made into a video. Once the videos are shown on the sixth day, the souls will depart for heaven with their selected memory. One remembers eating onigiris with their parents in the bamboo forest after a massive earthquake happened in their childhood, one recalls themselves flying a plane through the clouds during aviation training, and one struggles to choose the most meaningful memory before due. To Mochizuki and Shiori, this seven-day experience is the most valuable to them.\n\nA signature work by Hirokazu Kore-eda filled with lingering poetic visuals, leaving audience to ponder on death and departure from a different perspective. Before shooting, the production team interviewed 500 people in various locations, and selected 10 of them for cameos to talk about their real memories. The film is therefore a marriage of fiction and facts. Though the story belongs to the fantasy genre, it strongly illustrates a sense of everyday life. The video recording of memories resembles the shooting of a film, which act as Kore-eda’s tribute towards filmmakers. Viewers may cross reference the film with A Matter of Life and Death to read into the idea of facing death.",

        "desce": "The story takes place immediately after the well-known tragedy of Frankenstein, in which the monstrous creature is fleeing from a group of enraged villagers trying to burn it down along with the windmill to avenge for the death of a young girl. After the huge success by James Whale, who adapted Mary Shelley’s novel into the first Frankenstein film (1931), this sequel upgrades the philosophical debate, discussing the loneliness of the monster and the complexity of human nature. While the villagers think they destroyed the creature, turns out it is still alive; and worse, a scientist who is even crazier than Dr Frankenstein is preying on a chance to restart the unspeakable experiment — this time to create a female monster.\n\nHailed as the perfect sequel in cinema history, the film starts with Mary Shelley (starred by Elsa Lanchester) telling the horror story of Frankenstein in a castle. The tale gets religiously symbolic as it develops — the monster is misaccused as a murderer; its encounter with the blind hermit is an inspirational move to bring out the themes of love, belonging and their common needs to be understood, even for the monster/disabled; as well as their tragic fates being abandoned by their creators. The edgy appearance of the Bride of Frankenstein and its cast (also starred by Lanchester) brilliantly echo the themes. On the subject of man-made lifeforms, this film can be cross-referenced with Ex Machina.\n\nPost-screening Talk in Cantonese\nSpeaker: Dr Stephanie Ng",

The estate turns out to be a secret scientific research base, installed with an advanced artificial intelligence security system. Bateman has built a beautiful humanoid robot named Ava, and Caleb has been chosen to be the human component in a Turing test to determine whether she possesses human emotions and thinking, and if she can confuse Caleb with her capabilities that she might actually be a real person. To Caleb’s surprise, he slowly starts to sympathise Ava, and even begin plotting her escape.\n\nDebut of British director Alex Garland, the film unveils the discomfort and distrust of human beings towards AI technologies through its psychological thriller plot design, as the conflicts and struggles within the enclosed estate fuel the dramas with secrets, tests, and lies. Ava was set to be a female, resembling the femme fatale in classic film noir; while Bateman’s decision to build a lady robot serves to reflect the delusion of men’s objectification of female, and discusses the awakening of female’s self-awareness.\n\nPost-screening Seminar in Cantonese\nSeminar 1: The Magic of Imagination\nInnovation grows from imagination.

Ana’s father is busy tending to his beehives, while her mother is caught up in secretly writing letters to her distant lover. She becomes fascinated by the killing of the girl in the film. Her sister even claims that the monster is like a spirit, and Ana can talk to it if she closes her eyes and calls it. Believing her sister’s story about the desolate sheepfold being the hideout of the monster, Ana goes on a search and discovers mysterious footprints inside. Is Frankenstein really living in there?\n\nThis feature directorial debut by Víctor Erice is considered a masterpiece of Spanish cinema, as it surrealistically interrogates the fear of death and historical traumas through the eyes of the innocent little girl. Disintegrated familial relationships in the film echo with the people’s anxieties under Franco’s long regime. The work has eventually influenced Pan’s Labyrinth (2006) by Guillermo del Toro and My Neighbor Totoro (1988) by Hayao Miyazaki. Rife with oil painting like imageries and rich symbolism, the film is a bewitching and poetic daydream of one’s haunted memories. \n\nPost-screening talk in Cantonese on 13th January \nSpeaker: Ka Ming",

As they search for the girl, who is being hunted, they are led to uncover secrets of brain farms and an evil master plan about the robotic programmes.\n\nFrench director Jérémie Périn’s debut animation feature resembles the detective story in Polanski’s Chinatown (1974) that sets in a fantastical world borrowing from Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner (1982), with a splash of Mamoru Oshii’s Ghost in the Shell (1995). The film is a feast of futuristic fantasy that combines film noir and sci-fi. Among the adrenaline rushing action sequences, the story taps into the soul-implanted androids’ regrets and inability to truly enjoy family life, as well as human’s fear towards the potential mutiny of artificial intelligence.",

        "desce": "Squadron Leader Peter is trapped in a blazing bomber without a parachute. Preparing to die, he calls over radio and operator June picks up, listening to his last words — but the farewell is a bit too soon. Peter miraculously survives the jump out of the plane as the guiding angel misses him in the thick fog. Peter meets June and they fall in love, but his worsening concussion needs a surgery to cure. The heaven seizes the opportunity and tries to bring him to the other world whilst he undergoes the dangerous operation. Peter must now appeal before god for the love of his life and fight to stay alive on Earth.This imaginative fantastical classic by Powell and Pressburger has a witty and humorous take on life and death. The interesting comparison between the colourful Earth and the black and white heaven even gets the angel to remark: “One is starved for Technicolor up there.” The grand staircase leading up to heaven is decorated as a hall of fame; and the trial Peter goes through is a typical court drama, one that requires a defense attorney and a testimony to prove his true love. Regarding facing death, this film can be cross-referenced with >After Life.\n\nPost-screening talk in Cantonese by Horace Chan\nSpeaker: Horace Chan",
